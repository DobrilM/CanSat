  Got the bmp390 working, went straight ahead to the feather m0 and gave up one the uno :(
  It does give out strange values (1004.25 as opposed to the 1011-ish that we got at school), even though my phone says the same
  main issue could be that we are testing the sensor indoors and not outside, but that's a simple fix
  Also after a bit of research I realized that the pressure at sealevel should be around 1013.25, instead of the other values that
  we found online, because those are for the pressure on the ground.
  Anyways going on to the gps system.

  Well the GPS is running, i guess... It has a 0.0002 (demical) degree difference from my actual coordinates (both North/South and West/East),
  which results in a 8m difference from my exact location. Apparently it is due to the fact that i'm inside a building, but the specs of the
  sensor say that it has an accuracy of ~3m !!!under ideal conditions!!! I am unsure how the other wires, sensors and movement will affect the precision,
  but if we isolate it from the other parts it should work. Other than that parcing the data will be a hell, given the fact that it is in this wierd format:

  But I'll figure something about it later, right now I'll continue with the gyro/accelometer.

  Well, turns out we forgot to solder the pins for the gyro, so I'll do it next week. Either way I continued on to the rf95 on the feather, 
  and I ultimately got it running. 
  Turns out the code is way different than the apc220, but I still got it working in the end. Only thing is, after recieving the message, there is an
  unknown character (it outputs a box). It's probably a newline character, but because its a cstring, I'll need to look into how to parse it out. 
  Anyways, tomorrow I'll try the bmp and GPS outside and I'll try to put all the testcode into one file, but wiring the sensors together will 
  be a challenge, given the fact that I dont have any other wires ;-;. I'll probably get started on the function that calculates the direction for the drone
  and maybe the function for the Geiger Muller. I probably wont get all done, but at least I'll try.
