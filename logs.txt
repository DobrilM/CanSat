  Got the bmp390 working, went straight ahead for the feather m0 and gave up one the uno :(
  It does give out strange values (1004.25 as opposed to the 1011-ish that we got at school), even though my phone says the same
  main issue could be that we are testing the sensor indoors and not outside, but that's a simple fix
  Also after a bit of research I realized that the pressure at sealevel should be around 1013.25, instead of the other values that
  we found online, because those are for the pressure on the ground.
  Anyways going on to the gps system.
